resume_header_intro: "<p> *waves hi* ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, thanks for landing on my page! Let me introduce myself. My name is Sujal Patel, a recent graduate of Rutgers University New Brunswick. After four years of hard sweat and tears, I graduated and obtained a bachelors degree in Computer Science. During my last semester in college, I was fortunate enough to intern as an associate system engineer at Collabera Inc. After graduating, I became an Apple Support Engineer at Collabera where I oversee all Apple products ranging from setup to support. So if you have any Apple related question(s), feel free to message me. On my days off, I love to exercise and catchup on shows on popular streaming services. I am a big advocate on exercising and I encourage everyone to exercise daily as well as help me with some good movies or tv show recommendations. On top of that, I love to learn and teach people about new technologies ranging from rumors, tech support or even talk tech in general. My passion for tech has started since in middle school and from there, it only gotten greater and greater. My goal is to one day to become a Senior Server Admin or become a Director of IT in either Apple Support or in Azure/AWS. In the meantime, I hope everyone stays safe and I look forward in meeting you guys! </p>"
